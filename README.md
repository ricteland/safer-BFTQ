# safer-BFTQ

This repository provides a re-implementation of the Budgeted Fitted Q-iteration (BFTQ) algorithm, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm for safe exploration. The project is designed to be a testbed for different uncertainty quantification methods in deep reinforcement learning, including Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN), Monte Carlo Dropout, and Deep Ensembles.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

This project uses [Nix](https://nixos.org/) to manage dependencies. The `flake.nix` file defines the complete development environment. The main dependencies are:

- Python 3.12
- PyTorch
- Pyro
- Gymnasium
- highway-env
- NumPy
- SciPy

### Installation

1.  **Install Nix:** If you don't have Nix installed, follow the instructions [here](https://nixos.org/download.html).
2.  **Enable Flakes:** Make sure you have flakes enabled in your Nix configuration.
3.  **Start the development shell:** Open a terminal in the project root and run:

    ```bash
    nix develop
    ```

    This will drop you into a shell with all the necessary dependencies installed.

## Usage

### Training

To run the BFTQ agent, use the `quicktrian.py` script:

```bash
python quicktrian.py
```

To run the BNN-BFTQ agent, use the `train_bnn.py` script:

```bash
python train_bnn.py
```

This will start the training process with the default configuration.

### Logging

This project uses the standard Python `logging` module and TensorBoard for logging.

- **Console and File Logs:** The logs are printed to the console and saved to a file in the `logs/` directory.
- **TensorBoard:** TensorBoard logs are saved in the `logs/tensorboard/` and `logs/tensorboard_bnn/` directories. To view them, run:

  ```bash
  tensorboard --logdir logs/
  ```
